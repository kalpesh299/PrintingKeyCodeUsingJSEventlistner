# PrintingKeyCodeUsingJSEventlistner

* Created this webpage to learn the concept of HTML , CSS and JS 😉
  
* WHile creating this project i understood  how could we use DOM manipulation to created css and its logic.

* While createing this project i also deal with diffrent inbuilt methods or function like event.key and event.keycode etc.

* In this project when we are clicking on some key then we are getting its ascii code as a result.

# Tools
* VS Code❤
* Chrome Color Picker Extention to take refrence of color hexcode
* Online CSS Shadow generator
